# Nokia-5110-Oscilloscope
Basic single channel scope using an Arduino and Nokia 5110 LCD


This is my version of the Arduino oscilloscope code.  This file is strictly the display code for 
one analog channel.  It will soon be merged into my data logger project.

This is shared so others may incorporate the display code into their projects.  It has been modified to 
play nice with the Adafruit 5110 LCD library.

This is a work in progress but hopefully it will help someone else by providing
a base to start and work from.
